Normalization is a process of organizing database in a table which is used to minimise redundancy in a table.

## 1NF

- **First normal form**
- If the table holds atomic value.
- One attribute â†’ One attribute.
- Break rows if there are two values in any row.

## 2NF

- **Second Normal Form**
- Should be in First Normal Form.
- All non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on primary key.
- That basically means, seperate out tables to make a primary key.

## 3NF

- Third Normal Form
- Should be in Second Normal Form
- No Transitive Partial Dependency
- Break the table to remove this
