<p>"A system in which the failure of a computer you didn't even know existed can render your own computer unusable" - Leslie Lamport </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Multiple computers/machines typically communicating over a network</li>
<li>Can involve all elements of usual <a href="/cs/notes/t246wcci6dy9lnof7l1os4l">Executions</a>, but since a network and different environments are getting involved - things get tricky.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why">Why?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#why"></a></h2>
<p>Some applications are inherently distributed. Example, sending message from your phone to your friend's phone - no two ways about it.</p>
<p>But other reasons why you may choose to have distributed systems could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better reliability: Even if one node fails, system as a whole keeps functioning</li>
<li>Better performance: Get data from nearby node, rather than one halfway around the world</li>
<li>To solve bigger problems: Huge amounts of data - can't fit on one machine</li>
<li>Different applications/services talking to each other: Your app might need to talk to other applications or services over network. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-not">Why NOT?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#why-not"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Communications can fail -- and we might not even know it.</li>
<li>Malicious players</li>
<li>Processes themselves may crash - other systems might not be aware of it.</li>
<li>All these failures may happen nondeterministically.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-study">Why study?<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#why-study"></a></h2>
<p>The main challenge of having distributed systems is to keep them <strong>fault tolerant</strong> -- whole system should work despite failures of some parts.</p>
<p><strong>TIP</strong> If it can be done on one computer -> keep it that way </p>
