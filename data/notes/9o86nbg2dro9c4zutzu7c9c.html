<h1 id="class-cast-exception">Class Cast Exception<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#class-cast-exception"></a></h1>
<p>An exception occurs when a class which is not the superclass or which was not originally the superclass is casted.</p>
<p>For example, if Dog is casted to Cat. Or if Dog is upcasted to Animal and we try casting that Animal object to Cat.</p>
<p>It is advised to determine if the class you're downcasting is an instance of the class you're downcasting to.</p>
