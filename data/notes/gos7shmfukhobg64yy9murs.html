<p>You'll find this term being used at some places in these notes. The term "Object Context Qualifiers" is not used anywhere generally and is not a "real" Computer Science term, AFAIK. Its a term I use for my understanding to refer to keywords which are used to discern or "qualify" the context of a member in an object, that is, to identify if a member being referred to is a member of the current class of the object, or its superclass.</p>

<li><a href="/cs/notes/ko5vkc0lm91smqedbykoxka">Qualifier</a>s do refer to lexical tokens which are used to remove ambiguity while identifying entities. So that's where this comes from.</li>
<li>Another reason is Java's <a href="/cs/notes/bee58710sw7pnlvye1edgsx">Qualified this construct</a>.</li>
<li>These keywords are used in object contexts, not static ones.</li>
