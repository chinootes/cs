Occurs when [[os.memory.ram.user.stack]] overflows. 

## Common Causes

### Infinite Recursion

If a function calls itself without a proper termination condition, it can lead to an endless loop of function calls, eventually causing a stack overflow.

### Deep Call Stack

A function calling many other functions, or a series of functions calling each other in a long chain, can also exhaust the stack space.

### Large Local Variables

Allocating large data structures as local variables in functions can consume significant stack space.

### Excessive Function Arguments

Functions with a large number of arguments can increase the stack usage for each call.


## Prevention

### Proper Termination Conditions

Ensure recursive functions have conditions that will eventually stop the recursion.

### Limit Recursion Depth

If recursion is necessary, limit the depth to avoid excessive stack use.

### Optimize Local Variables

Use variables judiciously within functions and consider storing large data structures on the heap instead.

### Review Function Calls

Analyze the call graph of your program to identify potential deep call stacks or unintended recursion.
