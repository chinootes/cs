<p>It is necessary both numeric operands are compatible in size in an operation. If not, they're converted.</p>
<p>Here's how that happens (Rules)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If one operand is double, float or long</p>
<p>  the other promoted to double, float or long respectively</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Else</p>
<p>  both are considered int</p>
</li>
</ul>
