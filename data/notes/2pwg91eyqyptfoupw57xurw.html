<p>Parallelism is when multiple computations are <em>executed</em> at a time. Therefore at any instant, multiple executions are ongoing simultaneously. </p>
<p>Parellel computing doesn't need multiple tasks. Even one task can be split up into multiple sub-tasks and be assigned to different cores of the processor.</p>
<p><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596521547.do"><strong>The Art of Concurrency</strong></a> defines the difference as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A system is said to be</em> concurrent <em>if it can support two or more actions</em> in progress <em>at the same time. A system is said to be</em> parallel <em>if it can support two or more actions executing simultaneously.</em></p>
