Result of too much [[paradigm.oo.principles.abstraction]]. If you don't have a high-level understanding of a black box, its output may seem like magic.

Which means you should at least have some high-level knowhow of what's going on inside any system in order to use it => Grey boxes.

On the other hand, while designing a system, design it in such a way that there are no #surprisess. If that is the case, users wouldn't need to know your implementation details and you wouldn't have [[paradigm.oo.principles.abstraction.leaky]]

If you have to completely know the system in order to use it, then it doesn't make sense.
