## Cross-linguistic data formats

CLDF is a specification describing how to store cross-linguistic data (i.e. data about (many) languages) in a way that maximizes reusability. 
- pycldf implements this specification, providing tools to manipulate and validate CLDF datasets, based on csvw which implements the underlying CSVW spec.
