<blockquote>
<p>In Effective Java inside the item "Item 22: Favor static member classes over nonstatic" Josh Bloch says:    </p>
<p>Each instance of a nonstatic member class is implicitly associated with an enclosing instance of its containing class. Within instance methods of a nonstatic member class, you can invoke methods on the enclosing instance or obtain a reference to the enclosing instance using the qualified this construct.</p>
