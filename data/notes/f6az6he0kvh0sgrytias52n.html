<p>In an <a href="/cs/notes/60bq8mkkvu16sacffrxsn3k">Event Driven</a>, the applications generally have a main loop that listens for events and then triggers a callback function when one of those events is detected. In embedded systems, the same may be achieved using hardware interrupts instead of a constantly running main loop. Event-driven programs can be written in any programming language, although the task is easier in languages that provide high-level abstractions, such as await and closures.</p>
