<p>It means hiding.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://sanaulla.info/2008/02/29/overriding-vs-hiding/">Overriding v/s Hiding - sanaulla.info</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes you will see error messages from the compiler that talk about overriding static methods. Apparently, whoever writes these particular messages has not read the Java Language Specification and does not know the difference between overriding and hiding. So they use incorrect and misleading terlminology. Just ignore it. The Java Language Specification is very clear about the difference between overriding and hiding, even if the compiler messages are not. Just pretend that the compiler said "hide" rather than "override".</p>
