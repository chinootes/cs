<p>Its possible to write f.classMethod(). It is legal but a bad idea, since it causes confusion. The instance is not important in case of class methods. Only the declared type of 'f' matters.</p>
<p>Its better to write Foo.classMethod() or Bar.classMethod(). This not only makes it clear which class method you would like to call. But also, that it is indeed a class method which you're calling.</p>
<p>Of course, all this could be avoided by simply trying to not overide your static methods. You know, because <a href="/cs/notes/8qc6cuvuwpxqw73ck5r5jjy">Static Method Can't be overridden</a>.</p>
