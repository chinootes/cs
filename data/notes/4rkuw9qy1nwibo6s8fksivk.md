#interview-question

1. Abstracts DOM Manipulation - predictable behavior, easier to debug
2. Component-based Architecture - Modularized and reusable approach. Easier to maintain
3. Virtual DOM efficiently manages updates and rendering of components - Actual DOM Manipulation is slow and resource consuming

5. Flexibility - not a framework - focuses solely on view layer - can be used with other libraries and frameworks
6. React Native - Unified experience across devices
