Being an instance of something means to be the [[execution.lifecycle.runtime]] version of a [[execution.lifecycle.build]]/ [[execution.lifecycle.design]] template.

The instance is therefore built keeping the build time version as a template and it is what will actually get executed or be used in direct application.
