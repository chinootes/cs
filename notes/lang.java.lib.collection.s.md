Utility class (`java.util.package`) which defines several methods for collection objects.

## Size of Collection Objects

- **Default Initial Capacity**

    The initial capacity assigned to a Collection class object by default, if not specified while initializing the object.

- **Fill Ratio/Load Factor**

    The percentage or ratio of capacity which when reached will result in increasing of the capacity.

    For example, if the initial default capacity is 10 and fill ratio is 0.7 - the capacity will increase once 7 places are filled.

Reaches Max Cap → New AL object created with new capacity → all objects copied
