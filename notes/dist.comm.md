Communication between nodes can be either [[execution.synchronicity.sync]] or [[execution.synchronicity.async]].

The method to be used is mainly dependent on what kind of [[execution.synchronicity]], [[systems.char.performance.i.latency]] and [[systems.char.performance.i.throughput]] is required in the system.
