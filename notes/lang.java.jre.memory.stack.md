> Har thread ka ek stack. Har method ka ek stack frame.

- Each thread has a private JVM stack created at same time as thread
  - Used to store data and partial results which will be needed while returning value for method and performing dynamic linking
- Stores [[lang.java.jre.memory.stack.frame]]s
- References to objects stored here
