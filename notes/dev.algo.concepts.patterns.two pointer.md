Any algorithm involving use of two pointers/index variables to traverse over a data structure.

You take two pointers and move them untill you find the expected result.

There are many variants of this approach since the approach is only about taking two pointers. It only gets more concrete when we dig deeper.

Categorizing on basis of how the pointers move:

1. Running from both ends of an array

    - 
2. Slow & Fast Pointers
3. Running from beginning of 2 arrays / Merging 2 arrays
4. Split & Merge of an array / Divide & Conquer
