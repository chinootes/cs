Function composition is when output of one function is input to another. 

Functional programming encourages composing functions together to create new functions. This involves chaining functions together, where the output of one function becomes the input of another. Function composition allows for the creation of complex behaviors from simpler building blocks and promotes code reuse and modularity.
