- Errors are severe issues that typically occur due to serious problems outside the control of the program. They often lead to abnormal program behavior. 
- Errors are irrecoverable.

## Handling

- **Catching**: Generally not appropriate to catch errors. Can't be caught anyway.
- Then what? - Logging the error and exiting the program is recommended approach.
