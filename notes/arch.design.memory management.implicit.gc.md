- Garbage collection (GC) is a process that reclaims unused memory during program execution.
- When a program allocates memory for objects (such as variables, data structures, or objects created dynamically), some of that memory may become unreachable (i.e., no longer referenced by any part of the program).
- The garbage collector identifies and frees up this unreferenced memory, making it available for future allocations.
