## Common Causes 

### Insufficient RAM

When your machine doesn’t have enough RAM (Random Access Memory) available, it struggles to process applications, execute programs, or access files. As a result, you encounter the dreaded “out of memory” error.

### Startup Programs

Certain tasks or applications automatically run in the background when you start your system. These are known as startup programs. If these programs consume a significant portion of your system resources (including RAM), you may encounter the “out of memory” error.

### Outdated Hardware

Older computers with limited resources (such as low RAM or slow processors) can’t handle today’s data or processing demands. Consequently, they may trigger errors like the “out of memory” issue.

### Heavy Tasks

Resource-intensive activities like playing demanding PC games, creating 3D models, or editing high-quality videos can exhaust your system’s memory capacity, leading to the error.

### Malware

Malicious software running in the background can consume system memory, leaving little room for intended applications to function. This can result in the “out of memory” error.

### Memory Leaks

When [[programming.memory management.leaks]] in [[os.memory.ram.user.heap]] go out of hand.
