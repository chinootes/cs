## Ownership

Static members and methods are owned by the class itself, not any object.

## Accessing

- You don't need to create an instance or object to access static members.

    You can access them through class.

- [[paradigm.oo.components.modifiers.static.access using objects]]


## Initialization in program memory

Static members are loaded into program memory along with the class. Even before initializing any objects.

## Static stuff

- [[paradigm.oo.components.modifiers.static.variable]]
- [[paradigm.oo.components.modifiers.static.method]]
