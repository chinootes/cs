Tests ensure quality in delivery and consistency in results of your code/application.

Can be performed manually or be automated.

This also makes it easier to refactor code, to avoid [[dev.issues.bug.regression]], and to implement according to the TDD model. 


## Types

### Black Box Testing

Internal implementation is not known to the tester.


### [[dev.issues.bug.regression]] Testing

Done when some changes are made to the code. Some already existing test scripts are run again to see if the new changes have adversely affected the code.


## Test Driven Development (TDD)

Methodology in which you Write tests before you write your productive code.
