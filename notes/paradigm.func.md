> Computations are by nature evaluation of mathematical functions.

- Based on the above foundational statement.
- [[paradigm.declarative]] paradigm.
- [[programming.function]]s are first-class citizens. They can be assigned to variables and passed as an argument.

Functional programming implements concepts from Mathematical [[dendron://math/analysis.func]]tions in a way which avoid #surprises and promotes concise and readable code.

## Foundational Principles

1. [[paradigm.func.principles.immutability]]
2. [[paradigm.func.principles.composition]]
3. [[paradigm.func.principles.recursion]]
4. [[paradigm.func.principles.lazy]]
