Divides the application into distinct layers, each with a different responsibility and role.

Typically seperates the application into:

1. **Presentation layer**: Manages UI
2. **Service layer**: Orchestration of business logic and workflows. Handles user-requests and transactions.
3. **Business logic (domain) layer**: Contains business-specific (functional) logic and rules, i.e. validations, calculations etc. 
4. **Data access (persistence) layer**: Interaction with DB
5. **Infrastructure layer**: System and server etc.
